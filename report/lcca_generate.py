\noindent
This Life Cycle Cost Assessment (LCCA) has been carried out using a deterministic,
software-based approach. The analysis is based on standard engineering practice,
published guidelines, and reasonable assumptions adopted to ensure consistency,
transparency, and comparability of results. The key assumptions adopted in the
present study are summarized below.

\vspace{0.5em}

\begin{itemize}
\item The analysis period corresponds to the \textbf{design/service life of the bridge} as specified in the project data.
\item The study includes: initial construction, routine inspection, periodic maintenance, major inspections, repairs, replacement of bearings and expansion joints, reconstruction, demolition and disposal, and associated road user costs.
\item Only greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are considered for environmental cost monetization.
\item Other impacts such as noise pollution, local business impacts, regional economic disruptions, and broader social externalities are outside the scope of this study.
\item Components not explicitly defined in the input data or methodology are excluded.
\item Future technological advancement, policy changes, traffic growth variations, or economic structural shifts are not considered.
\item All costs are converted into present value terms.
\item The discounting approach is based on standard economic theory where future costs and benefits are adjusted to present value using a constant discount rate.
\item Inflation and interest rates are assumed constant over the analysis period.
\item Real interest rate principles are used in deriving the discount relationship.
\item Wholesale Price Index (WPI) ratios are used for escalation of specific cost components based on their respective commodity categories. WPI categories are used for adjusting the following components:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Passenger and crew cost $\rightarrow$ ``All Commodities''
  \item Property damage and spare parts $\rightarrow$ ``Manufacture of parts and accessories for motor vehicles''
  \item Human injury cost $\rightarrow$ ``Medical accessories''
  \item Petrol $\rightarrow$ ``Mineral Oils''
  \item Diesel $\rightarrow$ ``HSD (High Speed Diesel)''
  \item Engine oil $\rightarrow$ ``Lube oils''
  \item Grease and related oils $\rightarrow$ ``Mineral oil (grouped)''
  \item Tyre costs (by vehicle category) $\rightarrow$ Corresponding tyre index categories
  \item Fixed and depreciation cost $\rightarrow$ ``Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers''
  \item Commodity holding cost $\rightarrow$ ``Fuel \& Power''
  \end{itemize}
\item Initial construction costs are based on estimated quantities and prevailing unit rates from SOR.
\item Carbon emissions during construction are calculated using emission factors for material, transportation and energy consumption.
\item Emission factors are assumed constant over the entire analysis period.
\item Transportation of materials occurs under normal traffic and operating conditions.
\item Maintenance and repair emissions are assumed proportional to initial construction emissions.
\item Demolition and disposal emissions are assumed proportional to construction emissions.
\item Recycling is assumed to generate cost recovery (treated as negative cost).
\item Environmental cost is calculated by monetizing carbon emissions using a single Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) value.
\item Average Daily Traffic (ADT) is assumed constant within each defined analysis period.
\item Traffic composition (cars, two-wheelers, buses, LCVs, HCVs, MCVs) is based on input data.
\item Traffic diversion during construction, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconstruction, and demolition is assumed over a predefined detour length.
\item Vehicle operating cost, value of time, and accident cost are calculated using standard equations and accepted parameters.
\item Uniform traffic flow and average operating conditions are assumed during rerouting.
\item Routine inspections, periodic maintenance, major inspections, and repairs occur at fixed predefined intervals.
\item Maintenance and repair costs are calculated as a percentage of initial construction or superstructure cost.
\item Replacement activities are limited to bearings and expansion joints.
\item Reconstruction involves demolition of the existing bridge followed by construction of a new bridge with similar functional characteristics.
\item All interventions occur as scheduled without unplanned delays unless explicitly stated.
\end{itemize}

\item Traffic composition (cars, two-wheelers, buses, LCVs, HCVs, MCVs) is based on input data.
\item Traffic diversion during construction, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconstruction, and demolition is assumed over a predefined detour length.
\item Vehicle operating cost, value of time, and accident cost are calculated using standard equations and accepted parameters.
\item Uniform traffic flow and average operating conditions are assumed during rerouting.
\item Routine inspections, periodic maintenance, major inspections, and repairs occur at fixed predefined intervals.
\item Maintenance and repair costs are calculated as a percentage of initial construction or superstructure cost.
\item Replacement activities are limited to bearings and expansion joints.
\item Reconstruction involves demolition of the existing bridge followed by construction of a new bridge with similar functional characteristics.
